Before reporting a bug, lets make sure everything is right with your setup.

When reporting bugs, remember that Homebrew-Cask is an independent project from Homebrew. Do your best to direct bug reports to the appropriate project. If your command started with `brew cask`, bring the bug to us first.

Start by searching for your issue before posting a new one. If you find it and have any new information not reported in the original issue, please add your insights.

If you did not find your particular bug, before reporting it make sure you have the latest versions of Homebrew, Homebrew-Cask, and all Taps by running the following command, as well as fixing some other issues:

```bash
$ brew update; brew cleanup; brew cask cleanup;
$ brew uninstall --force brew-cask; brew update
$ brew untap phinze/cask; brew untap caskroom/cask; brew update
```

Retry your failing command. If the issue persists, [go back](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/README.md#reporting-bugs) and pick `My problem isnâ€™t listed` to fill our bug report template.
